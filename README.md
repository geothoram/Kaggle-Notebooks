## 15. Univariate Statistical Analysis on Diabetes

Univariate analysis is perhaps the simplest form of statistical analysis. Like other forms of statistics, it can be inferential or descriptive. The key fact is that only one variable is involved. Univariate analysis can yield misleading results in cases in which multivariate analysis is more appropriate.

## 13. (99% Acc.) Inception V3 on Rock, Paper & Scissor

I will use PreTrained Model Inception Netowrk to train my model. Off Course because we need to go deeper :) Inceptionv3 is a convolutional neural network for assisting in image analysis and object detection, and got its start as a module for Googlenet. It is the third edition of Google's Inception Convolutional Neural Network, originally introduced during the ImageNet Recognition Challenge. Just as ImageNet can be thought of as a database of classified visual objects, Inception helps classification of objects in the world of computer vision. One such use is in life sciences, where it aids in the research of Leukemia. It was "codenamed 'Inception' after the film of the same name".

## 12. Time Series Descriptive Statistics and Tests

There are different forecasting models like ARMA, ARIMA, Seasonal ARIMA and others. Each model addresses a different type of time series. For this reason, in order to select an appropriate model we need to know something about the data.In this section we'll learn how to determine if a time series is stationary, if it's independent, and if two series demonstrate correlation and/or causality.

## 11. Extracting Dominant Color of an Image

Clustering is used in much real-world application, one such real-world example of clustering is extracting dominant colors from an image.
Any image consists of pixels, each pixel represents a dot in an image. A pixel contains three values and each value ranges between 0 to 255, representing the amount of red, green and blue components. The combination of these forms an actual color of the pixel. To find the dominant colors, the concept of the k-means clustering is used. One important use of k-means clustering is to segment satellite images to identify surface features.

## 6. Reshampling Credit Card Data

There is 284807 observation of 31 variable. Class is target variable where as others are predictor variable. Information given in data is sesitive so i think data has been preprocessed with technique such as PCA or Factor Analysis, So we need not to put extra effort on Data Cleaning and Wrangling. Out of 284807 only 492 observations are detected Fraud so this data is highly imbalanced we will use different sampling technique to increase accuracy.

## 4. Speed Up Your Neural Network!!

If you need to tackle a very complex problem, such as detecting hundreds of types of objects in high-resolution images? You may need to train a much deeper DNN, perhaps with (say) 10 layers, each containing hundreds of neurons, connected by hundreds of thousands of connections. First, you would be faced with the tricky vanishing gradients problem (or the related exploding gradients problem) that affects deep neural networks and makes lower layers very hard to train. Second, with such a large network, training would be extremely slow. Third, a model with millions of parameters would severely risk overfitting the training set.

**In this Notebook, I will go through each of these problems in turn and present techniques to solve them.**

## 3. Machine Learning at Scale with PySpark

PySpark is a Python API for Spark released by the Apache Spark community to support Python with Spark. Using PySpark, one can easily integrate and work with RDDs in Python programming language too. There are numerous features that make PySpark such an amazing framework when it comes to working with huge datasets. Whether it is to perform computations on large datasets or to just analyze them, Data Engineers are switching to this tool.

## 2. Student Performance Correlation

A correlation coefficient is a numerical measure of some type of correlation, meaning a statistical relationship between two variables. The variables may be two columns of a given data set of observations, often called a sample, or two components of a multivariate random variable with a known distribution.
